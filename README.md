# Robot Navigation Simulation

## Overview

This project is a real-time simulation of robots navigating through a grid map with obstacles. The simulation is implemented using Streamlit and Plotly, showcasing robots' paths, messages, and obstacles.

## Features

- **Real-time Robot Simulation**: Visualize multiple robots moving from start to end positions on a grid map.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Display obstacles on the map using an image.
- **Communication Messages**: Display real-time messages about robots' statuses and alerts.
- **Simulation Control**: Pause and resume the simulation with a button.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Streamlit
- Plotly
- Pillow (PIL)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alag1/TMM-LMCO.git
   cd TMM-LMCO
